# Machine Learning Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project where we use Random Forest Classification to predict who survived the Titanic catastrophe. The project is based on the Kaggle Titanic competition and serves as a good starting point for beginners in the field of machine learning.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
In order to run the project navigate to the main directory and run the main file using the command `python main.py`.

### Dataset

Dataset belongs to the Kaggle Titanic competition and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

### Best Model

My best model achieved an accuracy of `0.77990` on the test set - roughly `78%`.
